"""
Brief overview of application:
Our application allows user to navigate the books database. Users are able
to search books using specific search criteria, including genre, publication 
year, author, ratings, and more. 

Users are also able to perform other actions, such as:
- add a rating of a book to the database
- add a book to their "to-read" shelf by adding an entry to the to-read table
- view information pertaining to books by authors of popular series 
in the database, such as the Harry Potter series, the Twilight Series, and more
- can be recommended a book by entering a book they liked. Then,
a similar book will be recommended by extracting information about the book they
liked, given that it is in the database.

Meanwhile, admin users can target specific readers and recommend them books
by accessing their top-rated or to-read books. They may also view top-rated
books within a specific timeframe to analyze the market for books.
