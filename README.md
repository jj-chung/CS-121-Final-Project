CS 121 Winter 2022 Final Project.

## Data Origin and Description
Our data set comes from the [goodbooks-10k dataset](https://github.com/malcolmosh/goodbooks-10k-extended/blob/master/README.md), an extended version of 
the [original goodbooks dataset](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) 
which was scraped from the Goodreads API in September 2017. The dataset contains 
information on the 10,000 most popular books on goodreads when it was collected. 
We selected columns that were most relevant to our application and renamed 
certain columns for more clarity. 

We have created 5 .csv files using the .csv files from the original goodbooks
dataset, each described below:
